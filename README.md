## Technologies Used
- **React Native:** The core framework for building the app.
- **Bun:** A fast and efficient JavaScript runtime used for package management and development. 🚀
  
## Key Packages
- **@react-navigation/native:** 
  - Used for navigation between different screens (e.g., Home, Add Recipe, Recipe Details). This package simplifies managing the navigation stack and enhances user experience.
  
- **@react-navigation/native-stack:** 
  - Enables the creation of a stack navigator for smooth transitions between screens. This is crucial for maintaining a logical flow in navigation.
  
- **react-native-reanimated:** 
  - Implemented for animations, enhancing the UI with smooth transitions and feedback on user interactions (e.g., when adding or viewing recipes). 🎉

- **@react-native-async-storage/async-storage:** 
  - Used to persist recipes locally, allowing users to retain their added recipes even after the app is closed and reopened. 💾

- **axios:** 
  - Utilized for making HTTP requests, particularly useful for fetching any external data, such as recipe details from an API if extended in future versions.

- **react-native-heroicons:** 
  - Provides icon components that are easy to use and integrate into the app, adding visual appeal to buttons and navigation elements. 🖼️

- **react-native-responsive-screen:** 
  - This package is used for creating responsive designs, ensuring the app looks great on devices of all sizes by adapting dimensions based on screen size.
